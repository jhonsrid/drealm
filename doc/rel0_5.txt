Changes from 0.4 to 0.5
-----------------------

Ctrl-C (and other events) no longer cause "get_raw: Interrupted system call"
error message (for example, at the "Override as sysop?" prompt in scanning).

Change to display.c (affects pager, displaymail and displaymsg) to _not_
print a newline after an ANSI message (where the last char was not a newline
already).

Menu output formatting has been introduced/tidied.  See menus.doc

download_special has been added.  See menus.doc

search_filenames and search_filedescs have been added.  See menus.doc

set_custom_var (var1 through var4) which are string variables for use as
parameters.  See menus.doc

Menus can now be located either in stated menu directory, or in
subdirectories under it which are named with a single character which stands
for the initial letter of the menu level name.  For example,
	display_menu Example.cmd
would search for "$menus$/Example.cmd" and then "$menus$/E/Example.cmd".
This is to speed directory searching when there are a very large number of
menus.

Added a new file, '.lastcall', which holds timestamp of the start of the
last connection to drealmBBS.  '.laston' is unchanged and holds the abend
flag and has a last-modified time of the last disconnect from drealmBBS.

Changed output of the word 'skip' to 'jump' where appropriate.
