Changes from 2.0 to 2.1
===========================================================

New facilities
--------------

New menu action "prompt_cr" for use when the menu requires a multi-character
input.  Users with hotkeys selected normally can only input a single
character at any menu.  This suspends hotkeys for duration of prompt.

New menu action forward_mail forwards one mail message to list of
recipients.  Internal mail only at the moment, sorry. Remains "from"
original sender, but "to" recipient of forwarding. "Forwarded by" line at
top of message body



Improvements
------------

Sample menus now also in ANSI colour as example.
MSTRINGCOUNT now set to 50 and using mstrings in sample menus

Changed default to [N]o when deleting message area

Prompted with "delete %s?" (default [N]o) when removing directory

"confirm for each?" prompt when removing files.

Now does not allow all-numeric handles to be created

new strings: Ustring[502] Can only forward mail internally.
             Ustring[503] %s, please try again.
             
Improved security: 
Menu line now fails if action line is too long
Config.drealm now fails if field is too long 
They both used to simply truncate.  This could under extreme circumstances
have resulted in a directory path getting truncated and thus leading the
user into a directory not desired.

New field in config.drealm C.filemode is the octal value of the perms
required on files placed in a public file area.  If downloading is to be
unbuffered the user must have access to the downloads directories under his
natural login permissions.

Catchup to recent messages now defaults to [Y]

Changed transstring to be more strict about word in \@@ but still ignores
case.  

-p parameter added to cp in file_to_public and file_to_user so that it
is easier to see when a file is getting old




Bug fixes
---------

Swapped the comment fields on lines 2 and 3 in config.files as they were the
wrong way round

Fixed bug that left forwarded mail to be read into the workpad later

Changed give_aka to strip ',' and ':' so as not to corrupt the passwd file

In file_to_user and file_to_public it was possible to send "null" files!
Fixed by chopping ends of remaining menu line after looking for child_dir

Bug in downloading permissions etc
Wasn't downloading from .dl directory for some reason!

ustrings.txt Ustring51 didn't agree with menu bar at Ustring55. 
Ustring51 Changed to 'h'

Corrected sizes of Ustring and Mstring arrays.

Wrong string was displayed when storing mail pointers

Incorrect string formatting when gagged user tried to post in area.

prabbit@rabbithole.vnet.net alerted us to the following two bugs - many thanks!

1. A wrong file could be displayed from within the display_it function under
some circumstances. Now fixed.

2. Using \$now$ in a menu line without a format string sometimes crashed the
program as it was trying to output the contents of null memory! Also now
fixed.
