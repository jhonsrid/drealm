<title>drealmBBS Bulletin Board System - Overview of drealmBBS facilities</title>

</head>

<body>

<p>This software has not been under development for some years now, and you may
notice that some of the guidance below is therefore out of date.</p>

<h1><a name=overview>Overview of drealmBBS facilities</a></h1>
<p>See below for <a href="#Compatibility">system compatibility.</a></p>

<p><span class="drealmbbs">drealmBBS</span> is a multi-user BBS system, suitable for scrolling terminals.</p>

<p><span class="drealmbbs">drealmBBS</span> runs a separate process for each node, and finds out about other
nodes by interrogating certain files on disk and via IPC. It needs about
1Mb virtual memory per user.</p>

<p>ALL data is produced and stored as plain ASCII so it can be accessed by any
other application.</p>

<p>It is highly configurable. All menu options can have access controlled
by user level, userflags, areaflags, and min/max times of day. Menus may
be presented in plain text or graphics standards such as ANSI.</p>

<p>You may offer your callers any of eight external file transfer protocols, any
three editors and any three display programs. We have included our own
line editor (isle) and our own display program (pager) which are both absolutely
free of shell escapes and command access. There is support for output in up to
10 human languages or styles.</p>

<p>Each BBS user has his/her own account in the passwd file, but may of course
run <span class="drealmbbs">drealmBBS</span> as his shell for security. Security is also aided by
reverting user to login permissions when using external file transfer protocols,
editors or file viewers - and other external programs optionally.</p>


<h1><a name=facilities>Facilities</a></h1>

<dl>
<dt>Private inter-user mail, with interface to external mail</dt>
<dd>A quota of external mail can be set per person, and mail can be made available only to
users over a certain level or with a certain flag set.</dd>

<dt>Message areas (forums)</dt>
<dd>Public messages are posted without naming a
recipient and can be read by anyone who may access a particular area. Areas can
be open or private, read only or read/write or moderated. Each area may have an
individual areamask, which represents the flag settings of the users who may
access it. An area may also be restricted to people of over a certain security
level. In the case of a &quot;private&quot; area access is restricted to
only people who are specifically named within that area. Messages are
linked as threads, and may be read threadwise, numerically, or by
&quot;reference&quot; (ie always reading down through replies first). Messages
may be unlinked, relinked in a different way, and copied to other message
areas. Whole threads or
branches may be copied to other areas, retaining their relationships.</dd>

<dt>Voting</dt>
<dd>Votes are attached to public messages.</dd>

<dt>File up/downloads</dd>
<dd>Functions to descend through directories and
re-ascend. File descriptions held. Files may be posted between individual
users. No internal protocol provided, you can use any which are available
on your system. Rename, delete, edit, view files. Searches recursively
from any named parent directory on filenames or file descriptions.</dd>

<dt>Chat</dt>
<dd>Realtime chat on a message by message basis via pipes and
sockets. Users can chat and listen whilst doing other things. Users
can select chat reception on or off. Menus may disable or enable chat at
any point. Broadcast chat to anyone listening, or a private message to
named person.</dd>

<dt>Timing</dt>
<dd>Session timers can be set on, off, or paused. Also total
time per day can be limited.</dd>

<dt>User defaults</dt>
<dd>An extensive range of user default choices including
inactivity timeout, hotkey mode, chat message colours. Also interface with
terminfo to allow user to choose his best terminal type for use
with external programs.</dd>

<dt>Run Unix commands (&quot;doors&quot;)</dt>
<dd>Either with BBS permissions or with
login permissions, as required for access and security.</dd>

</dl>

<p>All above are under total control of configuration files and the
semi-programmable menus. Each line of each menu can be made available only
at certain times, or only to people with a certain flag set or security level.</p>

<p>The nodes themselves may be configured to only accept callers fulfilling
certain criteria.</p>

<h1><a name="Compatibility">Compatibility</a></h1>

<p>Currently only Linux directly supported.</p>

<p>The source for the current release is developed with GNU make and GCC 2.5.8.
You may be able to port it to others.</p>

<p>The distributed executables were produced on kernel 1.2.13 with libc 4.6.27
in a.out format.</p>

<h2>Compilation</h2>
<p><span class="drealmbbs">drealmBBS</span> source is known to compile on the following setups:</p>
<pre>
GCC   Libc   Format 
2.5.8 4.6.27 a.out 
2.7.0 5.2.8  ELF
</pre>

<h2>Supplied binaries</h2>
<p><span class="drealmbbs">drealmBBS</span> a.out binaries as distributed are known to run on:</p>
<pre>
Kernel  Libc 
1.2.13  4.6.27 
1.3.100 4.6.27
</pre>

<p>It is now known that at kernel 2.x (and possibly earlier) the binaries MUST be
recompiled before running.</p>
