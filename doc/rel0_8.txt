Changes from 0.7 to 0.8
-----------------------

Removed hard-coded mtalk support (you can do it in the menus and we were).

Determine username using cuserid(NULL) to remove a security hole.

Prompt used in adduser program now passed by calling program, ready for
international language support from release 1.0

check_unix_mail now includes people equal to "extmaillevel", as well as
above.

drealmBBS LINT support corrected in Makefile.

Chat status when SILENT now inline with normal.

Some redundant code deleted.

Set stderr to line buffered, just in case.

Corrected laston/lastend code and removed a "memory fault".

Checked in pager that we have some idea of a controlling terminal.

Renamed "log" to "dlm_log" (in C - menu command not affected).

Fixed "edit_sig" to edit the sig rather than the plan.

Fixed "copy_mail" to truncate the sender's name to 14 characters, as this
was causing problems (like corrupt area headers when replying).  A "proper"
fix will be forthcoming.

Changed some error messages in timer.c to say timer.

Fixed chatout and timer on Linux not to block on open.  This prevents the
"timer: open: Interrupted system call" bug.  Also, removed time.$user file
on drealmBBS start up to prevent problems.

Fixed bug whereby a drealm account with no unix account caused drealmBBS to
abort (on Linux) when maintaining a user.  And when removing a user's
account.

Fixed assorted uninitialised variables, which have not yet reared their ugly
heads but might have been nasty to track down...

Empty strings are now treated as false in field formatting (for "yes/no",
"true/false" etc).

Changed narrative from "abort" to "abandon" in editing.

Added logging of BBS account deletion to newuserlog.

Made testing builtin flags consistent - i.e. only use '0' or 'not 0'.

Used ferror() to test for errors on streams (not a "< 0" test...).

Sorted the variable name tables (in the source) and removed some redundant
and undocumented variables.  Hopefully this won't break anything.

Moved various routines into different files (just for fun :-)) in the
source.

Fixed copying a list of messages from mail to an area.  (It took the header
of the first in the list for each message...)

Made "N/y" be "y/N" in no_yes.

Plugged some memory leaks.

Fixed memory fault in catalogue if user-id on file is not in /etc/passwd.

Checked all getpw* routines to make sure they cope with an user not in
/etc/passwd.  Some needed changing.

Stopped chatout and timer from thrashing (using up loads of CPU time) on
Linux.
