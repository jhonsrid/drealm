Changes from 0.2 to 0.3
-----------------------

Fixed bug which coredumped if you entered an empty pattern for a textsearch

Configurable case-sensitivity for filenames (eg downloads).  Now set in
C.filesensitive in config.drealm.  (occupies same line that used to be
C.speaklevel)

Added special linux bit to adduser.c, because linux passwd program didn't seem
to return an error when it failed to set a password!

Made file transfers, editing, and file display be done in the context of a
user's login group, for extra security while using the external programs.
