Changes from 0.8 to 1.0
-----------------------

Removed a line of debugging code from timer.c

Added a pause in timer.c and chatout.c to avoid getting EAGAIN on fast
Linux machines.

Elapsed time now calculated in GMT not local timezone...

Altered a test which resulted in chairmen being told they had to be a
chairman in order to delete threads!

Changed set_my_address/phone/dob/name to prompt more helpfully, and not give
error messages when they are being set for the first time.

Added menu actions download_ub and download_special_ub which are versions of
download and download_special which do not write files to be downloaded into
a safe directory first.  Maybe slightly less secure *in some circumstances*
but can speed up the downloading process.  Experiment for preference.

Changed "dlt" function to insert a single word timezone.  An expedient for
systems with no timezone set or with a multi-word time zone.  Previously
discrepancies here would mess up message headers.

Can use TERMCAP rather than TERMINFO.  drealmBBS works best with
ncurses-1.9.0c or later, as the TERMINFO support in that package is good.

In private mail, changed mark unread to never touch outgoing copies.

Fixed return codes from check_unix_mail so it returns Fail if there is no
further new mail since last check.

Changed mail_store which was on occasion trying to deal with an undefined
array and crashing the application!

drealm now looks for .plan and .sig in privatefiles directory rather than
home.  If this is the same thing on your system then so be it, no problem.

Amalgamated flag variable table with integer table.  Will not make any
functional difference.

pager, displaymsg and displaymail have altered.  displaymail always
paginates messages.  displaymsg always paginates messages unless they are
flagged as ANSI, in which case they never paginate.  pager always paginates
messages unless screen length is 0 (LINES environment variable) or the first
byte of the file is ESC (dec 27), on the assumption that this is a pretty
ANSI picture that is going to clear the screen to start with.  This
algorithm appears to work (otherwise it would be an heuristic...).

Fixed bug in place_lock.  When trying to burst a lock, it assumed that the
"remove" of the old lock worked, causing a loop if it didn't.  This was
the case with the sticky bit ('t') set on /tmp.  Code now gives up
gracefully.  We recommend you have a /drealm/tmp directory _without_ the
sticky bit set.

Played around with drealm_getchar and (I think) fixed a niggle with dropped
characters and chat.

In the mini-menus for setting editor or display program, attempts to choose
a number not on the menu would often crash the application.  There is now
some arbitrary input checking.

Made sure no debugging code left in anywhere.

Release the manual, at last.
