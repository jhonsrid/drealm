If you are upgrading from an earlier release of drealmBBS, follow steps
below as far back as necessary.  

If your current live version is prior to 1.0 we suggest starting from
scratch, but you can keep your existing message base.

========================================================================

Upgrading from 2.0 to 2.1

1. New field in config.drealm C.filemode is the octal value of the perms
   required on files placed in a public file area.  Put in place of the next
   spare field, leaving only two spare fields.
   
2. ustrings.txt changes: 

   Lines added in ustrings.txt.  
   Ustring[502] should say:  Can only forward mail internally
   Ustring[503] should say:  %s, please try again.

   Ustring[51] didn't agree with menu bar at Ustring[55].  Ustring[51]
   changed to 'h' on distributed copy.  
   
   Change your ustrings.txt to agree with above changes if you have already
   started customising the file, or else copy the new one over.

=====================================================================

Upgrading from 1.1 to 2.0

rename all your existing library .dlb files to .txt

copy over any .txt files in the library directory of this distribution which
you don't already have (eg nocreate.txt, ustrings.txt, mstrings.txt)

Edit your config.drealm so that Spare Field 1 becomes C.menucache. This
holds the amount of memory to be set aside for cached menus. It can be left
as 0 until you know if you want cached menus. (Look at new config.drealm
supplied in startercfgs directory to see how it should be changed, and see
manual section on menus for explanation of cached menus)

Edit your config.user so that Reserved Field 1 becomes $language$ and
Reserved Field 2 becomes $languagename$.  (Look at supplied in config.user
in startercfgs directory to see how it should look, and see manual section
on support for foreign languages to find out what it's all about!)

copy config.langs into your config directory, or create one to suit.

======================================================================

Upgrading from 1.0 to 1.1

Change needed in config.drealm.  Field after C.canlogin used to be Spare.
Field is now C.menucache, 0 by default.  See section on menus in manual.doc
for details.  Need new file, config.preload, if set to non-zero.
