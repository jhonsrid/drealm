		
This facility allows you to search for the occurence of a text string in
the a range of messages in the current area.

You have to put the text pattern you want searched for between quotes, which
means that you are allowed to put any characters you like in there, including
spaces and the ? and * wildcards.  It does not matter whether you type in
lower case or capitals because the search ignores case.  Don't forget if you
have put spaces, the search will actually try to match those spaces, so make
sure that everything between those "" is intended! 

Example: You type "beer" and you will get a list of messages which discuss
the merits of various brands of beer (or something like that).
