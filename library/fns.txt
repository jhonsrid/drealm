		
This facility allows you to search any downloadable files whose names match
a template you choose.

You can type in any string which appears anywhere in the filename, or a
pattern which includes the wildcards * or ?

The search is not case-sensitive.

Example: You type "tlx" and you will get a list of any files which are to
do with the telix comms package.
