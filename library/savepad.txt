After editing you will find yourself at the...

[S]ave to message, [e]dit, [l]ist, [?]help,
[h]old workpad, [c]lear workpad, [a]bort:

...prompt.

You may find yourself at this prompt even before having input anything
if your workpad was not empty for any reason.

[a] - abort. All editing is performed in your workpad and a safe copy is taken
      in case you make a mess of the edit and wish to abort.  This option
      restores your workpad as it was before you began the current input, and
      exits back to your Area prompt or whatever.  

[c] - clear.  This only clears your workpad and does not touch the finished
      product you were intending to produce. 

[s] - saves or sends the entire contents of your workpad file, with current
      updates, to its intended destination.  This may be a public message or a
      private mail item or a planfile or whatever.  
     
[l] - list, displays to you the final version of your edited file, as it would
      be shown if you chose to [s]ave. 
      
[h] - hold will save your workpad with any editing you have just done, but it
      will not send the results anywhere.  This option is useful if you want
      to refer to something on the system before completing your message, and
      means you will not have to start over again.  
      
[e] - edit the file again.  The updates at this point are still in your 
      workpad, and may be altered again before finally saving.  This is useful
      if you started in Line input mode and realise you need to tidy the text
      in the full screen editor.
